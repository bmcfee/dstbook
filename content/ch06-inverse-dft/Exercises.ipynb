    "2. A *low-pass filter* allows frequencies below some cut-off $f_T$ to propagate through, and blocks all frequencies above the cut-off.  Try implementing this on a signal of your choice by setting any DFT coefficients $X[m]$ to 0 if the corresponding frequency is above 500 Hz.  Apply the inverse DFT and listen to the results.  How does it sound?  Do you notice any artifacts?\n",
