4 linear and shift-invariant systems

    - systems
        - give lots of examples, both LSI and not

5 the discrete fourier transform

    - why?
    - (detour to complex appendix)
    - attempt 1: correlating with cosines
        - define comparison as sum-of-product

    - examples:
        - common DFT pairs
