5 the discrete fourier transform

    - why?
    - (detour to complex appendix)
    x attempt 1: correlating with cosines
        x define comparison as sum-of-product
        x rule: any frequency must complete a whole number of cycles ==> analysis frequency
    x attempt 2: phase problem, use a different shift?  multiple shifts?
    x attempt 3: the DFT
        x complex sinusoids
    - examples:
        - common DFT pairs
        x impulse / sinusoid [delay as special case]
