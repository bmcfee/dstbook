        - valid
        - same
        - full

4 linear and shift-invariant systems

    - systems
        - give lots of examples, both LSI and not
    - linearity
        - emphasize that this is useful beyond filtering, and is critical to DFT
    - time-shift invariance
    - how to determine LSI?
    - properties of LSI systems
        - convolution, algebraic properties
    

5 the discrete fourier transform

    - why?
    - (detour to complex appendix)
    - attempt 1: correlating with cosines
        - define comparison as sum-of-product
        - rule: any frequency must complete a whole number of cycles ==> analysis frequency
    - attempt 2: phase problem, use a different shift?  multiple shifts?
    - attempt 3: the DFT
        - complex sinusoids
    - examples:
        - common DFT pairs
        - impulse / sinusoid [delay as special case]
        - box and sinc
        - triangle and sinc^2
        - comb and comb
