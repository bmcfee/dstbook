# Properties of the DFT

In this chapter, we'll go more in depth with the DFT to understand its fundamental properties.
Specifically, we'll cover the following four topics:

- Linearity: what happens when we mix signals?
- The DFT shifting theorem: what happens when we delay signals?
- Conjugate symmetry: what is going on with negative frequencies?
- Spectral leakage: what happens to non-analysis frequencies?

A fair word of warning: this chapter will be technical and possibly a bit dry.
However, a good understanding of these properties will help us reason about the DFT applied to more complicated signals, and eventually, what the DFT can tell us about filtering.
