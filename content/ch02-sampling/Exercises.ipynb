    "1. Imagine you are given a sampled signal $x[n]$ of $N$ samples, taken at $f_s = 8000$ Hz.  If you derive a new signal $y[n]$ by taken every other sample from $x[n]$:\n",
    "    ```{math}\n",
    "    y[n] = x[2\\cdot n],\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    - What is the sampling rate $f_s$ of $y[n]$?\n",
    "    - What is the sampling period $t_s$ of $y[n]$?\n",
    "    - How many samples will $y[n]$ have?  (*Hint*: be sure to consider what happens when $N$ is even or odd.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If the sampling rate is $f_s = 100$ Hz, use the aliasing equation {eq}`aliasing` to find two aliases for each of the following frequencies:\n",
    "    - $f = 100$ Hz\n",
    "    - $f = -25$ Hz\n",
    "    - $f = 210$ Hz\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Imagine that you want to sample a continuous wave $x(t) = \\cos(2\\pi \\cdot f \\cdot t)$ of some arbitrary (known) frequency $f > 0$.  Which sampling rates $f_s$ would you need to use to produce the following discrete observations by sampling $x(t)$?  Express your answers as a fraction of $f$.\n",
    "    - $x[n] = 1, 1, 1, 1, \\dots$,\n",
    "    - $x[n] = 1, 0, -1, 0, 1, 0, -1, 0, \\dots$,\n",
    "    - $x[n] = 1, 1/2, 0, -1/2, -1, \\dots$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Which (if any) of these sampling rates satisfy the conditions of the Nyquist-Shannon theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using the {ref}`quantize function <quantize-function>` from this chapter, apply different levels of quantization (varying `n_bits` from 1 to 16) to a recording of your choice.  For each quantized signal, subtract it from the original signal and listen to the difference:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # We need to normalize the signal to cover the same range\n",
    "    # before and after quantization if we're going to compare them.\n",
    "    x_span = x.max() - x.min()\n",
    "    x_diff = x / x_span - quantize(x, n_bits) / 2**n_bits\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    What does it sound like for each quantization level?"
