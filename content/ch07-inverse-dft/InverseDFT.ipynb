    "## Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "Nowhere in the proof of the inverse DFT did we assume anything about the signal contents $\\blue{x[n]}$: it works for **any signal** $\\blue{x}$.\n",
    "The entire derivation relies on the definition of the forward transform coefficients $X[m]$, and a couple of observations about summing complex sinusoids.\n",
    "So what does this actually tell us about the DFT?\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse DFT gives us an alternative representation of signals: every signal $x[n]$ can be uniquely represented as a combination of sinusoids:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The summation in the inverse DFT $\\sum_{m=0}^{N-1}$ represents the \"combination\";\n",
    "- The coefficient $\\darkblue{X[m]}$ encodes the amplitude and phase of the $m$th sinusoid;\n",
    "- The complex exponential $\\green{e^{2\\pi\\cdot\\mathrm{j} \\cdot m \\cdot n / N}}$ represents the $m$th sinusoid itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until this point, we've occasionally had to assume that such a representation exists.  But now we've proven that it exists!\n",
    "\n",
    "Aside from analysis and theoretical properties, the inverse DFT gives us tools to *modify* signals.\n",
    "Rather than operating on individual samples, we can alter the DFT coefficients to produce desired effects, and then take the inverse DFT to recover the time-domain signal.\n",
    "We'll have more to say about the frequency domain view of filtering in later chapters, but in the next section, we'll see how to use this insight for synthesizing signals directly."
