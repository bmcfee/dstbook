# DFT Invertibility

In this short chapter, we'll derive the *inverse* of the Discrete Fourier Transform.

As we've seen previously, the DFT maps a time-domain input $x[n]$ to a frequency domain output $X[m]$.
The inverse DFT reverses this process, mapping the frequency domain input $X[m]$ to the time-domain output $x[n]$.
