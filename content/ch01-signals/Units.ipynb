    "## Why do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem like belaboring the point, but it serves a purpose.  When multiplying quantities together, you should be able to track what the corresponding units are.  This is often the easiest way to check whether your calculation is correct, and is a good skill to develop.\n",
    "\n",
    "By far, the most common types of mistakes that people make when first learning to work with signals arise from mis-matching quantities, such as adding a frequency to a phase angle, or dividing time by frequency rather than multiplying.\n",
    "These are errors that can be caught directly by checking units!\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that software doesn't really help us here.  Most of the time, we simply write down these quantities as numbers, and the computer has no idea what the numbers mean.  We therefore must be careful to document our assumptions carefully, so that we can reason about programs.\n",
    "For example, the program given above would be much better with a bit more explanatory documentation, like so:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "def x(t, amplitude, frequency, phase):\n",
    "    '''Compute the value of the wave at time t\n",
    "    with a given amplitude, frequency, and phase offset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Parameters\n",
    "    ----------\n",
    "    t : time in seconds (real number)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    amplitude : amplitude scaling (real number)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    frequency : cycles per second (real number)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    phase : offset in radians (real number)\n",
    "    '''\n",
    "    return amplitude * np.cos(2 * np.pi * frequency * t + phase)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because we're writing in Python, which allows us to define functions without clearly specifying the data types that it supports, we need to be explicit in documenting what the function expects (e.g., `real number`).\n",
    "However, even in strongly typed languages like Java (or, to some extent, C++), the computer still wouldn't understand the *semantics* of the different variables, like that time is measured in seconds (and not milliseconds or fortnights), or that phase is in radians and not degrees."
