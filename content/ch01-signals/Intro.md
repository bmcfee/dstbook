# Signals

This chapter introduces the concept of signals as mathematical objects.
We'll first establish some preliminaries and notation, then give an overview of waves and their role in signal analysis.
We'll finish with a quick discussion of units and dimensional analysis, and a high-level introduction to acoustics.
