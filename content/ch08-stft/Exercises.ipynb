    "1. Imagine you have a signal with length $N=44100$ sampled at $f_s = 44100$.  How many frames would you get if you take an STFT with frame length $N_F=4096$ and hop length $N_H=512$?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Sometimes, one does not want to discard any samples when performing an STFT.  This can be done by **padding** the signal with trailing zeros.  In the configuration from question 1, what is the smallest number of samples that you would need to add to capture the entire signal?\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Can you give a more general form for calculating the required padding, in terms of (unknown) parameters $N, N_F, N_H$?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The SciPy package provides an STFT implementation [`scipy.signal.stft`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.stft.html) which uses a slightly different parametrization that the one presented in this chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Using a (non-trivial) test signal $x$ of your choice, can you find parameter settings of `scipy.signal.stft` that produce identical output to the `wstft` function for $N_F=2048$ and $N_H=512$?\n",
