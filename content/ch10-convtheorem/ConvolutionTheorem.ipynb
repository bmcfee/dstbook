    "\n",
    "If $h$ and $x$ are of comparable length (say, both $N$ samples), then this can be more efficient than the {ref}`direct convolution algorithm <direct-convolution>`.\n",
    "The direct convolution has an outer loop of $N$ steps (one for each output sample) and an inner loop of $N$ steps (one for each delay), for a total of $\\sim N^2$ computation.\n",
