    "Notationally, we use curly braces $\\{\\}$ to denote a set.  For example, we could have a set consisting of three colors defined as\n",

    "Order is not important here: the the set above is equivalent to the set $\\{\\text{blue},\\;\\text{green},\\;\\text{red}\\}$.\n",
    "Repetition also does not matter: an element is either in the set or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the symbol $\\in$ (a funny-looking *E*, denoting *element*) to denote membership in a set:\n",
