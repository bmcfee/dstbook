    "## Summations\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout signal processing, we often need to add up long sequences of numbers. While we could easily express this using the standard $+$ notation, such as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 100,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "this can get cumbersome and difficult to read, especially when the terms of the summation involve other calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, mathematicians express summations using the $\\sum$ symbol, derived from the (capital) Greek letter *sigma* (equivalent to *S* in the latin alphabet, standing for *s*ummation).\n",
    "The summation above would be equivalently expressed as\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "S &= \\sum_{n=1}^{100} n\\\\\n",
    "&= 1 + 2 + 3 + \\dots + 100.\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation specifies the variable which is changing throughout the summation (in our case, $n$), and the start and end-points of the sum (1 to 100, inclusive) below and above the $\\sum$ symbol.\n",
    "Everything after the summation symbol describes what's being added up: in this case, just the values of $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's often helpful to think programmatically when reading summation expressions. \n",
    "The summation above would be translated to Python code as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "S = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python ranges do not include the end point, so we need to go one past where we want to stop\n",
    "for n in range(1, 101):\n",
    "    S = S + n\n",
    "```"
