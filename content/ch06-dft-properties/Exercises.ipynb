    "1. In general, magnitude is not a linear operation for complex numbers: $|w + z| \\neq |w| + |z|$.  Are there any special cases where this equality does hold?  That is, can you find two complex numbers $w$ and $z$ such that $|w + z| = |w| + |z|$?  If so, what general property must these numbers satisfy to ensure that equality holds?\n",

    "2. The DFT shifting theorem gives an equation to express $Y[m]$ as a complex rotation of $X[m]$ when $y[n]$ is a cyclic shift of $x[n]$.  For a fixed frequency index $m$ and signal length $N$, can you find a delay $d \\notin \\{0, N\\}$ such that $X[m] = Y[m]$?  That is, is there a non-trivial delay that leaves $X[m]$ unchanged?\n",
