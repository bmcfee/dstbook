This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts behind *filtering* and **convolution**.
We'll stick to the basics in this chapter, and leave the more detailed analysis for later chapters.

Specifically, we'll cover:
- How to build up convolution from simpler operations of delay, gain, and mixing
- Formally defining convolution
- The concept of **impulse response**
- Different convolution **modes**
- Algebraic properties of convolution (without proof)
